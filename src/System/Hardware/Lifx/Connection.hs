Description : Typeclass for a connection to LIFX bulbs

Stability   : experimental
Portability : GHC

This module contains the 'Connection' typeclass, which represents a
connection to a collection of LIFX bulbs.  For an implementation of
the 'Connection' class, you'll need another package, such as
@lifx-lan@ or @lifx-cloud@.
