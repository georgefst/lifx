LIFX TODO:

X add duration to color, power
X set label
X get group, location
- named colors
X default pulse in opposite color
X multiply brightness, saturation by 100
X migrate "types" to be used by lowlevel, too
configurable columns
get terminal width
X be smarter about how long to run
typeclass for LIFX
cloud interface
mock bulb
mock http server
X change power to boolean in records
X change label to Text in records
support both Wifi/Mcu Info/Firmware
- clean up argument parser by moving color to LiteArgs
more parallelism: get all first, then set all
change selectors (text for cmdline, allow multiple for API)
fix argument parsing
- add timed operation
Haddock docs
X ping stats on Control-C
tests
X split into multiple packages (lifx-base, lifx-lan, lifx-cloud, lifx-prog, columns)
caching (e. g. for groups, locations, scenes)

LIFX TODO 2:

Finish Haddock documentation.
tests for IgnoreUnknownSelector
test for powering on for effect
do planned renamings
port program to use typeclass
config file
X support unspecified interface
mock cloud API to test error handling
test NestedSceneIdSelector
Quickcheck tests for things which are round-trippable: IDs, JSON, messages, colors
X fancier UserAgent
obey rate limit for cloud API
should we provide instances like Hashable or Deepseq for IDs, colors, etc.?
X reorder LanSettings and CloudSettings to match better and to put rarely-used settings last
mark lights offline in Lan when they haven't been seen in a little while
test for bad access token
reimplement command line using optparse-applicative
change how sequence numbers are allocated
move "Interface" from LowLevel types to base types
expose all of the LowLevel messages?
implement cycleLights for Lan
properly handle parsing an empty selector list (since cloud seems okay with it)
add direction to cycle
use unbounded-delays in place of ThreadDelay
convert HTTP status codes to HttpException
